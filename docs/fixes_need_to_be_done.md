Code Cleanup: There are leftover files from the refactoring process that could cause confusion. These should be removed:
src/agents/claim_negotiator_day2_methods.py: This file is now obsolete as its logic has been integrated into claim_negotiator.py.
src/utils/error_handling_broken.py: This appears to be an older version of the error handling module.
Unit Test Coverage: While the architecture and demo scripts are strong, the unit tests (tests/unit/) are basic. Building out more specific unit tests for EscalationManager and EmotionAnalyzer would further solidify the codebase.
Documentation Synchronization: The docs/ folder contains excellent planning documents. A final README.md or ARCHITECTURE.md that reflects the final, refactored architecture would be beneficial for future development.
