Looking at this codebase, I can identify the **critical chokepoints** that are preventing the MVP from working:

## üö® **TOP 3 CHOKEPOINTS**

### 1. **Tool Import Path Inconsistency** 
**Location**: Throughout `src/tools/` vs `src/agents/`
**Issue**: Tools are importing `from portia.tool import Tool, ToolRunContext` but this import path doesn't match the actual Portia SDK structure. 

**Evidence**:
```python
# In tools files:
from portia.tool import Tool, ToolRunContext  # ‚ùå WRONG PATH

# But in base_agent.py:
from portia.tool_registry import ToolRegistry  # Different path structure
```

**Fix**: Need to correct the import paths to match actual Portia SDK structure.

---

### 2. **Audio Data Not Passed to Plan Execution**
**Location**: `claim_negotiator.py` line ~50
**Issue**: The audio data is never actually passed to the Portia plan execution, causing the emotion analysis to fail.

**Evidence**:
```python
# Creates plan but doesn't pass audio_data
emotion_plan = self.portia.plan(
    "Analyze customer emotion from the provided audio data using Hume emotion analysis tool."
)
emotion_run = self.portia.run_plan(
    emotion_plan,  # ‚ùå audio_data is missing here
    end_user=claim_data.get('customer_id', 'anonymous')
)
```

**The planner fails because `$audio_data` variable is referenced in the plan but never provided.**

---

### 3. **Tool Registry Registration Pattern is Broken**
**Location**: `base_agent.py` `_setup_tool_registry()` method
**Issue**: The way tools are being added to the registry is incorrect - creating multiple ToolRegistry instances.

**Evidence**:
```python
tools = ToolRegistry()  # Empty registry
for tool in custom_tools:
    tools = tools + ToolRegistry([tool])  # ‚ùå Creating new registry each time
```

**This pattern likely doesn't register tools properly with Portia.**

---

## üîß **Quick Fixes to Unblock MVP**

1. **Fix Tool Imports**: Change all tool imports to correct Portia SDK paths
2. **Pass Audio Data**: Modify plan execution to actually pass the audio_data parameter
3. **Fix Tool Registration**: Use proper ToolRegistry.add() or similar method instead of creating multiple registries

These three fixes should unblock the basic pipeline execution. The other issues (result extraction, LocalDataValue errors) are likely downstream effects of these core problems.
